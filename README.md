# 598MarsShuttle
MATLAB Code repository for AE598 Project 2. Maintained by Karthik Mahesh and Michelle Zosky

Contents:
- VSP MATLAB API (for reference, check out http://openvsp.org/). This API allows VSP functions to be executed in MATLAB
- Test Script for Newtonian Aerodynamics on an arbitrary body. Provides accurate values as tested with a cone at zero AoA.
- Test Geometries for a shuttle and a cone

To run, clone the repository, open test_script.m in MATLAB and execute. This will be divided into functions later.
